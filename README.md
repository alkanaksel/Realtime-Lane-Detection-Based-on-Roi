# Realtime-Lane-Detection-Based-on-Roi
In this project, the strips of the relevant region are determined by using some image processing methods, and then the strips are separated and shown with the polynomial method
Nonlinear transformation is used to increase the contrast of the image. The multi-angle edge detection method is used to detect strip edges. After the edges are determined, the lanes on the road are detected with the Hough Transformation. Polynomial feet are used to fit dashed strip lines, and then the lane line direction is estimated by the least squares method.
